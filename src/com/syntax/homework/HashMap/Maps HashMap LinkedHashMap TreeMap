Maps in java:
    -Map is an interface in java that allows us to store key value pairs.
    -Keys cannot be duplicate, but values can.
    -There are many types of maps, but we will only discuss three of them, and will also touch a fourth one.
    1)HashMap   2)LinkedHashMap     3)TreeMap       4)HashTable(Slow and old because of thread sleep)

HashMap:
    Upside: It's the fastest of all.
    Downside: Does not maintain the insertion order.

LinkedHashMap:
    Upside: Order is maintained.
    Downside: Retreival speed is slow. Insertion speed is better than TreeMap but slower than HashMap.

TreeMap:
    Upside: Data is always stored in the sorted form.
    Downside: Insertion speed is the slowest of all. Retrieval speed is slower than HashMap, but faster than LinkedHashMap.

HashTable:
    It is old and slow, but provides thread safety.

Note:
    There are three ways to get the data from a map
        1) EntrySet(): key-value store inside an object of type Map.Entry. We can use getKey() method on this object
    to get the key of that entry and getValue() method to get the value of that entry.
        2) KeySet(): It will return all the keys from a map in the form of a set.
        3) values(): It will return us all the values from a map in the form of a collection.
