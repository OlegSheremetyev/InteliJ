What is Abstraction:
ABSTRACT is providing only the necessary details and hiding all implementations details;
Why should we learn Abstraction:
1)It reduces the code complexity by separating the idea from implementation;
2) It helps use enforce rules and convey our requirments.
How can we use Abstraction:
1)create classes with abstract keyword.
2)use the abstract keyword with method header and dont provide the body of that method inside the parent class.
3) create the child classes and extend those classes from parent class and implement the abstract methods.
4) if we dont want to provide the implementation one or more methods we can declare the child class as abstract as well.
